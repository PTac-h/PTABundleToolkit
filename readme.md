# PTA Plugin Loader | PTA Bundle Toolkit

A small project aiming to improve some of the constraints and hassles of developping MODS for MelonLoader.


### Goals

- Incorporate the Unity Editor during the development process of a mod.
- Bring a wide range of content into a game using Assets Bundles.
- Cut down a lot of "IDLE time" by enabling plugin hot reloads.
- Automatic incorporation of custom classes into the game's dll.
